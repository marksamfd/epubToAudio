                    dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor
                    man.</b></i></p>&#13;\n<p class="imageb1-li"><img alt="" height="2" src="../images/line.jpg"
                width="800" /></p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was
            highly educated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than
            two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to
            do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth
            grade.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their
            lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The other would become one of
            the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his
            church. The other left bills to be paid.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Both men were strong, charismatic,
            and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed
            strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">If I had
            only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads offered me the choice of
            contrasting points of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Instead
            of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, comparing, and then
            choosing for myself. The problem was that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man <span
                class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" title="2" />was not yet poor. Both were just starting
            out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had very different points
            of view about money.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">For example, one dad would say, \xe2\x80\x9cThe love of
            money is the root of all evil.\xe2\x80\x9d The other said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe lack of money is the root of all
            evil.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing
            me was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The
            contrast in their points of view, particularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and
            intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying.</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="bodytext">Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as,
            \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does he say that?\xe2\x80\x9d and then asking the same question of the other
            dad\xe2\x80\x99s statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, he\xe2\x80\x99s
            right. I agree with that.\xe2\x80\x9d Or to simply reject the point of view by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe old
            man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, having two dads whom I
            loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a process, choosing for
            myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point
            of view.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the
            middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us
            learn about money from our parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? They simply say,
            \xe2\x80\x9cStay in school and study hard.\xe2\x80\x9d The child may graduate with excellent grades, but
            with a poor person\xe2\x80\x99s financial programming and mindset.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Sadly,
            money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on financial
            skills. This explains how smart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades may struggle
            financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part to highly educated
            politicians and government officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the subject of
            money.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"
                title="3" />Today I often wonder what will soon happen when we have millions of people who need
            financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent upon their families or the government for financial
            support. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a nation survive if
            teaching children about money continues to be left to parents\xe2\x80\x94most of whom will be, or already
            are, poor?</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them.
            I had to think about each dad\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the power
            and effect of one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on one\xe2\x80\x99s life. For example, one dad had a habit of
            saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.\xe2\x80\x9d The other dad forbade those words to be used.
            He insisted I ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I afford it?\xe2\x80\x9d One is a statement, and the other is a
            question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain
            that by automatically saying the words \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it,\xe2\x80\x9d your brain
            stops working. By asking the question \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I afford it?\xe2\x80\x9d your brain is put to
            work. He did not mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical about exercising your mind,
            the most powerful computer in the world. He\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy brain gets stronger every day
            because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.\xe2\x80\x9d He believed that
            automatically saying \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it\xe2\x80\x9d was a sign of mental laziness.</p>
        &#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting his
            brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term
            result was that one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from
            a person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching
            television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases
            your chances for wealth.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">My two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected
            the way they thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less
            fortunate. The other said, \xe2\x80\x9cTaxes punish those who produce and reward those who don\xe2\x80\x99t
            produce.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"
                title="4" />One dad recommended, \xe2\x80\x9cStudy hard so you can find a good company to work
            for.\xe2\x80\x9d The other recommended, \xe2\x80\x9cStudy hard so you can find a good company to
            buy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">One dad said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason I\xe2\x80\x99m not rich
            is because I have you kids.\xe2\x80\x9d The other said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason I must be rich is because I
            have you kids.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">One encouraged talking about money and business at
            the dinner table, while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal.</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="bodytext">One said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to money, play it safe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take
            risks.\xe2\x80\x9d The other said, \xe2\x80\x9cLearn to manage risk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="bodytext">One believed, \xe2\x80\x9cOur home is our largest investment and our greatest
            asset.\xe2\x80\x9d The other believed, \xe2\x80\x9cMy house is a liability, and if your house is your
            largest investment, you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Both dads paid
            their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the other paid his bills last.</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="bodytext">One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you and your needs. He was
            always concerned about pay raises, retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and other
            perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a
            retirement-and-entitlement package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of
            medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also loved the tenure system
            available through the university. The idea of job protection for life and job benefits seemed more
            important, at times, than the job. He would often say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard for the
            government, and I\xe2\x80\x99m entitled to these benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">The
            other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the entitlement mentality and how it
            created weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="bodytext">One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created investments. One dad taught me
            how to write an impressive resum\xc3\xa9 so I could find a good job. The other taught me how to write strong
            business and financial plans so I could create jobs.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext"><span class="right_1"
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5" title="5" />Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury
            of observing the effects different thoughts have on one\xe2\x80\x99s life. I noticed that people really do
            shape their lives through their thoughts.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">For example, my poor dad always
            said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never be rich.\xe2\x80\x9d And that prophecy became reality. My rich dad,
            on the other hand, always referred to himself as rich. He would say things like, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m
            a rich man, and rich people don\xe2\x80\x99t do this.\xe2\x80\x9d Even when he was flat broke after a major
            financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by saying,
            \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is
            eternal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">My poor dad would say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not
            interested in money,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cMoney doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d My rich dad
            always said, \xe2\x80\x9cMoney is power.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">The power of our thoughts
            may never be measured or appreciated, but it became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important to be
            aware of my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was poor, not because of the
            amount of money he earned, which was significant, but because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy
            having two fathers, I became acutely aware of being careful about which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own.
            Should I listen to my rich dad or to my poor dad?</p>&#13;\n<p class="imaget1-li"><img alt="" height="2"
                src="../images/line.jpg" width="800" /></p>&#13;\n<p class="centerm"><i><b>There is a difference between
                    being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.</b></i></p>&#13;\n<p
            class="imageb1-li"><img alt="" height="2" src="../images/line.jpg" width="800" /></p>&#13;\n<p
            class="bodytext">Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they disagreed about
            what they thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job to
            earn money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or an accountant, and to go to
            business school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how money works, and
            to learn how to have it work for me. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t work for money!\xe2\x80\x9d were words
            he would repeat over and over. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney works for me!\xe2\x80\x9d</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">At
            the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I chose not to
            listen to my poor dad, even though he was the one with all the college degrees.</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="subheadingk"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6" title="6" /><i><b>A Lesson from
                    Robert Frost</b></i></p>&#13;\n<p class="normal">Robert Frost is my favorite poet. Although I love
            many of his poems, my favorite is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Road Not Taken.\xe2\x80\x9d I use its lesson almost daily.
        </p>&#13;\n<p class="poem-ts"><b>The Road Not Taken</b></p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Two roads diverged in a yellow
            wood,</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">And sorry I could not travel both</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">And be one
            traveler, long I stood</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">And looked down one as far as I could</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="poem">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Then took the other, as just as
            fair,</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">And having perhaps the better claim,</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Because it
            was grassy and wanted wear</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Though as for that the passing there</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="poem">Had worn them really about the same,</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">And both that morning equally
            lay</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Oh, I kept the
            first for another day!</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Yet knowing how way leads onto way,</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="poem">I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">I shall be telling this with a
            sigh</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Somewhere ages and ages hence;</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">Two roads diverged
            in a wood, and I\xe2\x80\x94</p>&#13;\n<p class="poem">I took the one less traveled by,</p>&#13;\n<p
            class="poem">And that has made all the difference.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext-ts"><span class="right_1"
                epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7" title="7" /><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"
                title="8" />And that has made all the difference.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Over the years, I have
            often reflected upon Robert Frost\xe2\x80\x99s poem. Choosing not to listen to my highly educated
            dad\xe2\x80\x99s advice and attitude about money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped
            the rest of my life.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Once I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my
            education about money began. My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years until I was 39 years old. He
            stopped once he realized that I knew and fully understood what he had been trying to drum into my
            often-thick skull.</p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is
            financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain
            power over it and can begin building wealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because
            most people went to school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives working for money.
        </p>&#13;\n<p class="bodytext">Because I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich dad taught
            me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there were only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years.
            This book is about those six lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad put forth
            those lessons to me. The lessons are meant not to be answers, but guideposts that will assist you and your
            children to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty.</p>
